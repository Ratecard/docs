  This is the webhook model. It contains the information regarding a webhook and it's metadata. Metadata will be added in a future update. Metadata will contain information about the events, webhook calls and additional data.

  Webhooks can be both inbound and outbound.

  ## Inbound webhooks
  Inbound webhooks are basically a wrap around our API (with predefined or additional behaviour in some cases). They provide a way to send data to our app without making a full integration with the API. The URL property of the webhook will be the URL you or your app will send data to with a `POST` request. The `events` property is called actions in our app as you will perform actions with the webhook when it is inbound.

  The URL of the inbound webhook is the same URL as the regular webhooks API endpoint, our API will know the difference between 

  ## Outbound webhooks
  Outbound webhooks send data to an URL you specify based on the events the webhook is subscribed to, which is why we call the `events` property 'subscriptions' in our app. When an event happens e.g. `messages.sent` we will `POST` the relevant data surrounding the message and the event to the URL you've defined.
