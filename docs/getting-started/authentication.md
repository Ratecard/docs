# Authentication
In this article you'll learn everything about authenticating with our API.
___
To be able to authenticate with our API you have to generate an access token in your account ([here](https://ratecard.io/app/settings/api)). If you don't have access to the Ratecard account and/or the API settings page please ask the owner/admin of your account to supply you with this token.

## Methods
The Ratecard API supports 3 methods of authenticating with access tokens.
<!--
type: tab
title: Bearer Auth
-->
> Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources.

```http
GET https://api.ratecard.io/v1/contacts
Connection: Keep-Alive
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Accept: application/json
```

<!--
type: tab
title: HTTP Header
-->
> Similar to the bearer auth, the `Ratecard-AccessToken` header can be used as an alternative.
```http
GET https://api.ratecard.io/v1/contacts
Connection: Keep-Alive
Ratecard-AccessToken: <access_token>
Accept: application/json
```

<!--
type: tab
title: Parameter
-->
> As an alternative to the header based authentication methods you can also pass a query parameter called `access_token` in the request. This parameter is accepted in the URL, application/x-www-form-urlencoded content, multipart/form-data content or JSON body.
